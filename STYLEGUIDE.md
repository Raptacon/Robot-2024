# Raptacon Style Guide

This document is intended to provide a standard for how to write code for this repository or other Raptacon repositories. 

As of October 12, 2024, this guide is not necessarily being followed.
The expectation is that all _new_ code being submitted follows these guidelines.
If refactoring old code to follow these guidelines:  
* If the branch contains any functional changes, only code that is already affected by the functional changes should be refactored.
Refactoring other code pollutes the diff and makes reviewing difficult.  
* If refactoring specifically for style, only style changes may be included in the branch. Do not include any functional changes in a style refactoring branch.
